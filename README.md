# Relaxation-voltage
Code for paper: Voltage relaxation-based state-of-health estimation of lithium-ion batteries using convolutional neural networks and transfer learning. 

dataset2 contains dataset1 and dataset2 from paper. dataset stores dataset3 used in paper. process_mat.py,process_mat2.py,process_mat3.py are the relevant processing codes for dataset3.
CNN_BAO.py, LSTM.py, ML_mode.py contain the evaluation process of CNN, LSTM and machine learning models on dataset1 respectively.
TL_Dataset2.py and TL_MMD_Dataset2 are the transfer learning of CNN-FT and MK-MMD on dataset2
ev_cnn_FT.py is the code for CNN-FT on dataset3.
